# Quickstart: Use the Bing Custom Search .NET client library

Get started with the Bing Custom Search client library for C#. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks. The Bing Custom Search API enables you to create tailored, ad-free search experiences for topics that you care about. The source code for this sample can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples/tree/master/BingSearchv7/BingCustomWebSearch).

Use the Bing Custom Search client library for C# to:

- Find search results on the web, from your Bing Custom Search instance.

Reference documentation | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/Search.BingCustomSearch) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch/1.2.0) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-dotnet-sdk-samples)

## Prerequisites

- A Bing Custom Search instance. See [Quickstart: Create your first Bing Custom Search instance](../../how-to/quick-start.md) for more information.
- Microsoft [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- Any edition of [Visual Studio 2017 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
- If you are using Linux/MacOS, this application can be run using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/).
- The [Bing Custom Search](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch/1.2.0)  NuGet package.
  - From **Solution Explorer** in Visual Studio, right-click your project and select **Manage NuGet Packages** from the menu. Install the `Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch` package. Installing the NuGet Custom Search package also installs the following assemblies:
    - Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime
    - Microsoft.Rest.ClientRuntime.Azure
    - Newtonsoft.Json

## Create and initialize the application

1. Create a new C# console application in Visual Studio. Then add the following packages to your project:

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Linq;
    using Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Search.CustomSearch;
    ```

2. In the main method of your application, instantiate the search client with your API key.

    ```csharp
    var client = new CustomSearchAPI(new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials("YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"));
    ```

## Send the search request and receive a response

1. Send a search query using your client's `SearchAsync()` method, and then save the response. Be sure to replace your `YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID` with your instance's configuration ID (you can find the ID in the [Bing Custom Search portal](https://www.customsearch.ai/)). This example searches for "Xbox":

    ```csharp
    // This will look up a single query (Xbox).
    var webData = client.CustomInstance.SearchAsync(query: "Xbox", customConfig: Int32.Parse("YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID")).Result;
    ```

2. The `SearchAsync()` method returns a `WebData` object. Use the object to iterate through any `WebPages` that were found. This code finds the first webpage result and prints the webpage's `Name` and `URL`.

    ```csharp
    if (webData?.WebPages?.Value?.Count > 0)
    {
        // find the first web page
        var firstWebPagesResult = webData.WebPages.Value.FirstOrDefault();

        if (firstWebPagesResult != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Number of webpage results {0}", webData.WebPages.Value.Count);
            Console.WriteLine("First web page name: {0} ", firstWebPagesResult.Name);
            Console.WriteLine("First web page URL: {0} ", firstWebPagesResult.Url);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Couldn't find web results!");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Didn't see any Web data..");
    }
    ```
