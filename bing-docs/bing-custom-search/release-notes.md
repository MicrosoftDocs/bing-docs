# Release notes for Custom Web Search API

See the following sections for information about changes that were included with each release.

## October 30, 2020

Initial release of this version of Bing Custom Web Search API. This API replaces the same API hosted by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search/" target="_blank">Azure Cognitive Services</a>, which is being phased out. 

### New to Bing Search?

To subscribe to a package that includes this API, see [Create Bing Search Service resource](../bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource.md). Next, get familiar with the [Custom Web Search API](overview.md) documentation, and be sure to check out the [quickstarts](quickstarts/quickstarts.md) to get up and running quickly.


### Current Cognitive Services user?

Things current Cognitive Services users must do prior to their subscription ending:

1. Update your application to use your Bing Search Services subscription key. Current Cognitive Services users that want to maintain continuity of service should sign up [here](../bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource.md) for a Bing Search Services subscription before their Azure Cognitive Services subscription ends. 
  
2. Update your app to use the new endpoints. For the new endpoints, see [Custom Search API](reference/endpoints.md) reference.
