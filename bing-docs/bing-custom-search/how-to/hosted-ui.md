# Configure your hosted UI experience

Bing Custom Search provides a hosted UI that easily integrates into your webpage using JavaScript. You can configure the UI's layout, color, and search options in the Custom Search portal.

## Configure your hosted UI

To configure a hosted UI for your web applications, follow these steps. As you make changes, the pane on the right provides a preview of what the UI will look like. (The displayed search results are not actual results for your instance.)

1. Sign in to the [Custom Search portal](https://customsearch.ai).  
  
2. Select your Custom Search instance.

3. Click the **Hosted UI** tab.  
  
4. Select a layout.

    - Search bar and results (default): Displays a search box with search results below it.  

    - Results only: Displays search results only, without a search box. When using this layout, you must provide the search string (`&q=<search string>`). Add the query parameter (*q*) to the request URL in the JavaScript snippet, or the HTML endpoint link.  

    - Pop-over: Provides a search box and displays the search results in a sliding overlay.

5. Select a color theme. You can customize the colors to fit your application by clicking **Customize theme**. To change a color, either enter the color's RGB HEX value (for example, `#366eb8`) or click on the color preview.

   You can preview your changes on the right side of the portal. Clicking **Reset to default** reverts your changes to the default colors for the selected theme.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Consider accessibility when choosing colors.

6. Under **Additional Configurations**, provide values as appropriate for your app. These settings are optional. To see the effect of applying or removing them, see the preview pane on the right.  

7. Enter the search subscription key or choose one from the dropdown list. The dropdown list is populated with keys from your Azure account's subscriptions.

8. If you enabled autosuggest, enter the autosuggest subscription key or choose one from the dropdown list. The dropdown list is populated with keys from your Azure account's subscriptions.

## Publish or revert a search instance

Custom search has two environments: staging/testing (see the **Configuration** tab) and production (see the **Production** tab). When you create a new instance or make changes to an existing instance, those changes occur in the testing environment.

After configuring and validating your changes, click **Publish** to make your hosted UI configuration live. Changes are not reflected against your production endpoints until you publish.

Before publishing, if you decide that you don't want to keep the changes you've made, click **Revert**. When you revert your changes, the **Published** version remains unchanged and the **Configuration** version is reverted to match the **Published** version.

## Consume your custom UI

To consume your hosted UI after publishing it, select the **Production** tab and then select the **Endpoints** tab. In the list of endpoints, click **Hosted UI**.

Click **Additional parameters** if you want to include the *safeSearch* query parameter or specify the language to use for user interface strings.

Finally, use one of the following options to access your custom hosted UI:

- Copy the JavaScript snippet and paste it into your webpage. The following is an example only (copy the actual snippet from the portal).
  
  ```html
  <html>
      <body>
          <script type="text/javascript" 
              id="bcs_js_snippet"
              src="https://ui.customsearch.ai/api/ux/rendering-js?customConfig=<YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID>&market=en-US&safeSearch=Moderate&version=latest&q=">
          </script>
      </body>    
  </html>
  ```

- Or, copy and use the URL to access your custom UI in a web browser. The following is an example only (copy the actual URL from the portal).  
  
  `https://ui.customsearch.ai/hosted-page?customConfig=<YOUR-CUSTOM-CONFIG-ID>&market=en-US&safeSearch=Moderate&version=latest&q=`
