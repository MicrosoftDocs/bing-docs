# Custom Web Search API v7 query parameters

The following are the query parameters that the request may include. The Required column indicates whether you must specify the parameter. You must URL encode the query parameter values.  
  
|Name|Value|Type|Required
|-|-|-|-
|<a name="cc"></a>cc|A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see [Market codes](market-codes.md#country-codes).<br/><br/>If you set this parameter, you must also specify the [Accept-Language](headers.md#acceptlanguage) header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds in the specified languages and combines it with the country code to determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request. Or, Bing may use an aggregated or default market for the results.<br/><br/>To know which market Bing used, get the [BingAPIs-Market](headers.md#market-header) header in the response.<br/><br/>Use this query parameter and the `Accept-Language` header only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, you should use the `mkt` and `setLang` query parameters.<br/><br/>This parameter and the [mkt](#mkt) query parameter are mutually exclusive &mdash; do not specify both.|String|No
|<a name="count"></a>count|The number of search results to return in the response. The default is 10 and the maximum value is 50. The actual number delivered may be less than requested.<br/><br/>Use this parameter along with the `offset` parameter to page results. For more information, see [Paging results](../../bing-web-search/page-results.md).<br/><br/>For example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set `count` to 10 and `offset` to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment `offset` by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results. This parameter affects only webpage results and has no impact on the number of results that Bing returns for other answers in the search results such as images or videos.|UnsignedShort|No
|<a name="customconfig"></a>customConfig|Unique identifier that identifies your custom search instance.|String|Yes
|<a name="mkt"></a>mkt|The market where the results come from. Typically, `mkt` is the country where the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form \<language>-<country/region>. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market codes](market-codes.md).<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in Market codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change.<br/><br/>To know which market Bing used, get the [BingAPIs-Market](headers.md#market-header) header in the response.<br/><br/>This parameter and the [cc](#cc) query parameter are mutually exclusive &mdash; do not specify both.|String|No  
|<a name="offset"></a>offset|The zero-based offset that indicates the number of search results to skip before returning results. The default is 0. The offset should be less than ([totalEstimatedMatches](response-objects.md#totalmatches) - `count`).<br/><br/>Use this parameter along with the `count` parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set `count` to 10 and `offset` to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment `offset` by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results.|Unsigned Short|No
|<a name="query"></a>q|The user's search query term. The term may not be empty.<br/><br/>**NOTE:** The query string must not contain [Bing Advanced Operators](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/advanced-search-options-b92e25f1-0085-4271-bdf9-14aaea720930). Including them may adversely affect the custom search experience.|String|Yes
|<a name="safesearch"></a>safeSearch|Used to filter webpages for adult content. The following are the possible filter values:<br/><ul><li>Off &mdash; Returns content with adult text.</li><li>Moderate &mdash; Returns webpages with adult text.</li><li>Strict &mdash; Does not return adult text.</li></ul>The default is Moderate.<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that `safeSearch` be set to Strict, Bing ignores the `safeSearch` value and uses Strict.<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If you use the `site:` query operator, there is a chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what the `safeSearch` query parameter is set to. Use `site:` only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.|String|No  
|<a name="setlang"></a>setLang|The language to use for user interface strings. You may specify the language using either a 2-letter or 4-letter code. Using 4-letter codes is preferred.<br/><br/>For a list of supported language codes, see [Bing supported languages](market-codes.md#bing-supported-language-codes).<br/><br/>Bing loads the localized strings if `setlang` contains a valid 2-letter neutral culture code (**fr**) or a valid 4-letter specific culture code (**fr-ca**). For example, for **fr-ca**, Bing loads the **fr** neutral culture code strings.<br/><br/> If `setlang` is not valid (for example, **zh**) or Bing doesnâ€™t support the language (for example, **af**, **af-na**), Bing defaults to **en** (English).<br/><br/>To specify the 2-letter code, set this parameter to an ISO 639-1 language code.<br/><br/>To specify the 4-letter code, use the form \<language>-<country/region> where \<language> is an ISO 639-1 language code (neutral culture) and <country/region> is an ISO 3166 country/region (specific culture) code. For example, use **en-US** for United States English.<br/><br/>Although optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set `setLang` to the same language specified by `mkt` unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.<br/><br/>This parameter and the [Accept-Language](headers.md#acceptlanguage) header are mutually exclusive &mdash; do not specify both.<br/><br/>A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects use the specified language.|String|No  
|<a name="textdecorations"></a>textDecorations|A Boolean value that determines whether display strings in the results should contain decoration markers such as hit highlighting characters. If **true**, the strings may include markers. The default is **false**.<br/><br/>To specify whether to use Unicode characters or HTML tags as the markers, see the [textFormat](#textformat) query parameter.<br/><br/>For information about hit highlighting, see [Hit highlighting](../../bing-web-search/hit-highlighting.md).|Boolean|No
|<a name="textformat"></a>textFormat|The type of markers to use for text decorations (see the `textDecorations` query parameter).<br/><br/>The following are the possible values:<br/><ul><li>Raw &mdash; Use Unicode characters to mark content that needs special formatting. The Unicode characters are in the range E000 through E019. For example, Bing uses E000 and E001 to mark the beginning and end of query terms for hit highlighting.<br/><br/></li><li>HTML &mdash; Use HTML tags to mark content that needs special formatting. For example, use \<b> tags to highlight query terms in display strings.</li></ul>The default is Raw.<br/><br/>For a list of markers and information about processing strings with the embedded Unicode characters, see [Hit highlighting](../../bing-web-search/hit-highlighting.md).<br/><br/>For display strings that contain escapable HTML characters such as <, >, and &, if `textFormat` is set to HTML, Bing escapes the characters as appropriate (for example, < is escaped to \&lt;).|String|No
