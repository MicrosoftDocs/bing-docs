# Release notes for Autosuggest API

See the following sections for information about changes that were included with each release.

## October 30, 2020

Initial release of this version of Bing Autosuggest API. This API replaces the same API hosted by <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-autosuggest/" target="_blank">Azure Cognitive Services</a>, which is being phased out.

### New to Bing Search?

To subscribe to a package that includes this API, see [Create Bing Search Service resource](../bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource.md). Next, get familiar with the [Autosuggest API](overview.md) documentation.

### Are you a current Cognitive Services user?

Things current Cognitive Services users must do prior to their subscription ending:

1. Update your application to use your Bing Search Services subscription key. Current Cognitive Services users who want to maintain continuity of service should sign up [here](../bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource.md) for a Bing Search Services subscription before their Azure Cognitive Services subscription ends.
  
2. Update your app to use the new endpoints. For the new endpoints, see [Autosuggest API](reference/endpoints.md) reference.

If you use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-local-business-search/local-search-reference" target="_blank">Local Business Search API</a>, it's not available in Bing Search Services.
