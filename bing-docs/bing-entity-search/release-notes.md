# Release notes for Entity Search API

See the following sections for information about changes that were included with each release.

## October 30, 2020

Initial release of this version of Bing Entity Search API. This API replaces the same API hosted by [Azure Cognitive Services](/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services), which is being phased out. 

### New to Bing Search?

To subscribe to a package that includes this API, see [Create Bing Search Service resource](../bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource.md). Next, get familiar with the [Entity Search API](overview.md) documentation, and be sure to check out the [quickstarts](quickstarts/quickstarts.md) to get up and running quickly.


### Current Cognitive Services user?

Things current Cognitive Services users must do prior to their subscription ending:

1. Update your application to use your Bing Search Services subscription key. Current Cognitive Services users that want to maintain continuity of service should sign up [here](../bing-web-search/create-bing-search-service-resource.md) for a Bing Search Services subscription before their Azure Cognitive Services subscription ends. 
  
2. Update your app to use the new endpoints. For the new endpoints, see [Entity Search API](reference/endpoints.md) reference.

If you use [Local Business Search API](/azure/cognitive-services/bing-local-business-search/local-search-reference), it's not available in Bing Search Services.
