# Entity Search API v7 response objects

For a list of possible objects, see **In this article** in the right pane.

If the request succeeds, the top-level object in the response is the [SearchResponse](#searchresponse) object. And if the request fails, the top-level object in the response is the [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse) object.

> [!NOTE]
> Because URL formats and parameters are subject to change without notice, use all URLs as-is. You should not take dependencies on the URL format or parameters except where noted.

## Entity  

Defines an entity such as a person, place, or thing.  
  
|Name|Value|Type
|-|-|-
|bingId|An ID that uniquely identifies this entity.|String  
|contractualRules|A list of rules that you must adhere to if you display the entity. For example, the rules may govern attribution of the entity's description.<br/><br/>The following contractual rules may apply:<ul><li>[LicenseAttribution](#licenseattribution)</li><li>[LinkAttribution](#linkattribution)</li><li>[MediaAttribution](#mediaattribution)</li><li>[TextAttribution](#textattribution)</li></ul>Not all entities include rules. If the entity provides contractual rules, you must abide by them. For more information about using contractual rules, see [Attributing Data](/bing/search-apis/bing-web-search/data-attribution).|Object[]
|description|A short description of the entity.|String  
|entityPresentationInfo|Additional information about the entity such as hints that you can use to determine the entity's type. To determine the entity's type, use the `entityScenario` and `entityTypeHint` fields. For example, the fields help you determine whether the entity is a dominant or disambiguation entity and whether it's a person or movie.<br/><br/>The entity is a dominant entity if Bing believes that only one entity satisfies the request. If multiple entities could satisfy the request, the entity is a disambiguation entity and the user needs to select the entity they're interested in.|[EntityPresentationInfo](#entitypresentationinfo)

|queryScenario|The supported query scenario. This field is set to DominantEntity or DisambiguationItem. The field is set to DominantEntity if Bing determines that only a single entity satisfies the request. For example, a book, movie, person, or attraction.<br/><br/>If multiple entities could satisfy the request, the field is set to DisambiguationItem. For example, if the request uses the generic title of a movie franchise, the entity's type would likely be DisambiguationItem. But, if the request specifies a specific title from the franchise, the entity's type would likely be DominantEntity.|String
