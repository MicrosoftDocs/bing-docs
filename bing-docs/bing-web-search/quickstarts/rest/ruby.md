# Quickstart: Use Ruby to call the Bing Web Search API  

Use this quickstart to make your first call to the Bing Web Search API. This Ruby application sends a search request to the API, and shows the JSON response. Although this application is written in Ruby, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

## Prerequisites

Here are a few things that you'll need before running this quickstart:

* [Ruby 2.4 or later](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* A subscription key

<!--

-->

## Create a project and declare required modules

Create a new Ruby project in your favorite IDE or editor. Then, require `net/https` for requests, `uri` for URI handling, and `json` to parse the response.

```ruby
require 'net/https'
require 'uri'
require 'json'
```

## Define variables

A few variables must be set before we can continue:

1. Confirm that the `uri` and `path` values are valid and replace the `accessKey` value with a subscription key from your Azure account.

2. Optionally, customize the search query by replacing the value for `term`.

```ruby
accessKey = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
uri  = "https://api.bing.microsoft.com"
path = "/v7.0/search"
term = "Microsoft Bing Search Services"

if accessKey.length != 32 then
    puts "Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!"
    puts "Please paste yours into the source code."
    abort
end
```

## Make a request

Use this code to make a request and handle the response:

```ruby
# Construct the endpoint uri.
uri = URI(uri + path + "?q=" + URI.escape(term))
puts "Searching the Web for: " + term

# Create the request.
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = accessKey

# Get the response.
response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end
```

## Print the response

Validate the headers, format the response data as JSON, and print the results.

```ruby
puts "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n"
response.each_header do |key, value|
    # Header names are lower-cased.
    if key.start_with?("bingapis-") or key.start_with?("x-msedge-") then
        puts key + ": " + value
    end
end

puts "\nJSON Response:\n\n"
puts JSON::pretty_generate(JSON(response.body))
```

## Put it all together

The last step is to validate your code and run it. If you'd like to compare your code with ours, here's the complete program:

```ruby
require 'net/https'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

accessKey = "enter key here"
uri  = "https://api.bing.microsoft.com"
path = "/v7.0/search"
term = "Microsoft Bing Search Services"

if accessKey.length != 32 then
    puts "Invalid Bing Search API subscription key!"
    puts "Please paste yours into the source code."
    abort
end

uri = URI(uri + path + "?q=" + URI.escape(term))
puts "Searching the Web for: " + term

request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key'] = accessKey

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port, :use_ssl => uri.scheme == 'https') do |http|
    http.request(request)
end

puts "\nRelevant Headers:\n\n"
response.each_header do |key, value|
    if key.start_with?("bingapis-") or key.start_with?("x-msedge-") then
        puts key + ": " + value
    end
end

puts "\nJSON Response:\n\n"
puts JSON::pretty_generate(JSON(response.body))
```

## Example JSON response

Responses from the Bing Web Search API are returned as JSON. This sample response has been truncated to show a single result.
