#### Taxes

Prices are exclusive of any taxes unless otherwise specified on the invoice as tax inclusive.

Microsoft will be responsible for all taxes based on its net income, gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of taxes on income or profits, or taxes on its property ownership.

If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments you make to Microsoft, you may deduct such taxes from the amount owed to Microsoft and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority; provided, however, that you promptly secure and deliver an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents Microsoft reasonably requests to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You must ensure that any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.

## Data collection and privacy

**Microsoft may collect information from you or End Users such as, but not limited to, an End User's IP address, requests, time of submissions and the results returned to the End User, in connection with transaction requests to the Services.** All access to and use of the Services, including Microsoft's processing of Bing Search Services Data, is subject to the data practices set forth in the then-current Privacy Statement, a current copy of which is available at <https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement>.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Standard Terms, the Services and all Content are provided **"as is"** without warranty or SLA of any kind by Microsoft or its suppliers. To the maximum extent permitted by law, any and all representations, warranties, or conditions of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, implied or statutory warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy or satisfactory quality), all with regard to the Services and any Content, are expressly excluded by Microsoft and its suppliers. Microsoft and its suppliers make no warranty that the Services will operate properly as integrated with the Applications, that the Services will be uninterrupted, or that any Content will be accurate or complete. Microsoft and its suppliers specifically disclaim any liability for End Users' reliance on the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, Microsoft and its suppliers will not be liable for harm to End Users resulting from reliance on any Content provided hereunder.

## Disclaimer of consequential damages

Neither party nor Microsoft's suppliers will be liable for any indirect damages (including, without limitation, consequential, special or incidental damages, damages for loss of profits or revenues, business interruption, or loss of business information), arising out of or related to the Services, Content, or these TOU, even if advised of the possibility of such damages or if the possibility was reasonably foreseeable.

## Limitation of Liability

The aggregate liability of each party for all claims under this agreement is limited to direct damages up to the amount paid under this Agreement during the 12 months before the cause of action arose.  None of the limitations and exclusions in [Disclaimer of consequential damages](#disclaimer-of-consequential-damages) or [Limitation of Liability](#limitation-of-liability) apply to claims related to either party's violation of the other party's intellectual property rights or to any obligation to pay fees or to either party's [defense obligations](#5-obligations).

## Defense

#### 1. By Microsoft

Microsoft will defend you against any claims made by an unaffiliated third party that the Services infringe that third party's patent, copyright or trademark or makes unlawful use of its trade secret.

#### 2. By you

You will defend Microsoft against any claims made by an unaffiliated third party that:

1. any Application, Bing Search Services Data, product or services you provide, directly or indirectly, in using the Services infringes the third party's patent, copyright, or trademark or makes unlawful use of its trade secret;
1. arises out of LLM Use; or
1. arises from violation of [LLM use](#5-llm-use), [Use of the services](#use-of-the-services), or the Bing Search APIs, with your LLM Use and Display Requirements.

#### 3. Limitations

Microsoft's obligations in the [section 1](#1-by-microsoft) will not apply to a claim or award based on:

1. any Application, Bing Search Services Data, third party product or service, modifications you make to the Services, or services or materials you provide or make available as part of using the Services
1. your combination of the Product with, or damages based upon the value of, your Application, Bing Search Services Data, or any third party product, service, data, or business process
1. your use of a Microsoft trademark without our express written consent, or your use of the Services after we notify you to stop due to a third-party claim.
1. your redistribution of the Services to, or use for the benefit of, any unaffiliated third party
1. LLM Use
1. Services provided free of charge

#### 4. Remedies

If we reasonably believe that a claim under [section 1](#1-by-microsoft) may bar your use of the Services, we will seek to:

1. obtain the right for you to keep using it or
1. modify or replace it with a functional equivalent and notify you to stop use of the prior version of the Services. If these options are not commercially reasonable, we may terminate your rights to use the Services and then refund any advance payments for unused Services.

#### 5. Obligations

Each party must notify the other promptly of a claim under this Section. The party seeking protection must

1. give the other sole control over the defense and settlement of the claim
1. give reasonable help in defending the claim.

The party providing the protection will

1. reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that it incurs in giving that help and
1. pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment or settlement.

The parties' respective rights to defense and payment of judgments (or settlement the other consents to) under this section are in lieu of any common law or statutory indemnification rights or analogous rights, and each party waives such common law or statutory rights.

## Term and termination

These TOU are effective upon your acceptance. Either party may terminate these TOU if the other party is in breach of any material term and fails to cure it within 30 days after written notice that describes the breach. In the event of termination by Microsoft due to your uncured material breach, all rights granted to you by these TOU will automatically terminate and you will cease to have any rights to use the Services and all unpaid amounts for Services delivered prior to termination automatically become due and payable. Microsoft may revoke the [LLM Use rights granted above](#5-llm-use) at any time upon 30 days written notice.

## Services updates

We may change the Services at any time. Some changes to the Services may cause your Applications to stop working. Microsoft will make commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of material changes or updates to the Services.

## Suspension

We may suspend your use of the Services if:

1. it is reasonably needed to protect the security of the Services, any third parties or any other Microsoft product or service
1. you fail to respond to a claim under [Defense Section](#defense) within a reasonable time
1. you do not pay amounts due under this agreement or
1. you violate the terms of this TOU

If Microsoft suspends your use of the Services, Microsoft will suspend only to the extent reasonably necessary; provided, however, that in the event of a violation of the [LLM Use terms](#5-llm-use), Microsoft may suspend your access to all Services immediately, with or without notice. Unless Microsoft believes an immediate suspension is required or you have violated the LLM Use terms, Microsoft will provide reasonable notice before suspending the Services for the reasons stated above. We will give at least 30 days' notice before suspending for non-payment. If you do not fully address the reasons for the suspension within 60 days after we suspend (or within 7 days after we suspend for violation of the [LLM Use terms](#5-llm-use)), we may terminate your access to the Services. We may also terminate your access to the Services if your use is suspended more than twice in any 12-month period.

## Changes to the TOU

We may update these TOU from time to time. We will notify you of any changes as provided by [Notices](#notices). If you do not agree to the changes, then you must stop using the Services. If you do not stop using the Services, then your use of the Services will continue under the changed TOU. If we choose to change the fees for the Services, Microsoft will provide notice of such terms as provided in [Notices](#notices), and you may elect to stop using the Services rather than incurring fees.

## Notices

We will send any legal notices under this TOU, including notices required by law, to the email address associated with your Microsoft Azure Marketplace account. You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date. Notices provided to you via email will be deemed given and received on the transmission date of the email. If you do not consent to receive notices electronically, you must stop using the Services.

## Compliance with laws

You must comply with all laws and regulations applicable to you and your End Users' use of Services, including laws related to privacy, data protection, and U.S. export laws.

## Miscellaneous

You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these TOU, including in connection with a change of control, without Microsoft's prior written consent. Any purported assignment and delegation will be ineffective. We may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under these TOU, fully or partially without notice to you.
