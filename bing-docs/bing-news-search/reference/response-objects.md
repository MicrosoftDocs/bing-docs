# News Search APIs v7 response objects

For a list of possible objects, see **In this article** in the right pane.

The top-level object in the response depends on the endpoint you call. If you call `/news/search` or `/news`, the top-level object in the response is the [NewsAnswer](#newsanswer) object; and for `/news/trendingtopics`, it's [TrendingTopicAnswer](#trendingtopics). If the request fails, the top-level object is the [ErrorResponse](#errorresponse) object.

> [!NOTE]
> Because URL formats and parameters are subject to change without notice, use all URLs as-is. You should not take dependencies on the URL format or parameters except where noted.
