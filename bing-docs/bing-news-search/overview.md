# What is the Bing News Search API?

Bing News Search API lets your users find headline news, news by category, and trending articles. If you're looking to build an experience similar to [bing.com/news](https://www.bing.com/news), this is the API to use.

## Get started

To get started using the API, pick the subscription you want from <a href="https://aka.ms/bingsearchapipricing" target="_blank">Bing API Pricing</a>. After getting your subscription key, you're all set to make your first call.

You can easily call the API by sending a native HTTP GET request or by using the News Search SDK.

## Features

While Bing News Search API primarily focuses on finding relevant news articles, it also provides several features for intelligent and focused news retrieval on the web.

|Feature|Description
|-|-
|[Get general news](how-to/search-for-news.md)|Gets general news stories based on the user's search query. If the search query is empty, the API returns top news articles from different categories.
|[Today's trending news stories](how-to/trending-news.md)|Gets news stories that are trending on social networks.
|[News by category](how-to/category-news.md)|Search for news in specific news categories like business, sports, or entertainment.        |

Bing also provides API metrics, which you can use to inform your strategic decisions. Quickly retrieve statistics such as your top queries, call volume, market distribution, response code summary, and many more. For details, see [Bing Web Statistics](../bing-web-search/bing-web-stats.md).

### Search or search-like experience

Bing News Search API may only be used as a result of a direct user query or search, or as a result of an action within an app or experience that logically can be interpreted as a user’s search request. For illustration purposes, the following are some examples of acceptable search or search-like experiences.

- User enters a query directly into a search box in an app.
- User selects specific text or image and requests “more information” or “additional information”.
- User asks a search bot about a particular topic.
- User dwells on a particular object or entity in a visual search type scenario.

If you are not sure if your experience can be considered a search-like experience, check with Microsoft.
