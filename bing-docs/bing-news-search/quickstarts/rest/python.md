# Quickstart: Perform a news search using Python and Bing News Search REST API

Use this quickstart to make your first call to Bing News Search API. This simple Python application sends a search query to the API and processes the JSON result. 

Although this application is written in Python, the API is a RESTful Web service compatible with most programming languages.

To run this code sample as a Jupyter Notebook on [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org), select the **launch binder** badge: 

[![launch binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/cognitive-services-notebooks/master?filepath=BingNewsSearchAPI.ipynb)

The source code for this sample is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/blob/master/python/Search/BingNewsSearchv7.py).

## Create and initialize the application

Create a new Python file in your favorite IDE or editor, and import the request module. Create variables for your subscription key, endpoint, and search term. 

```python
import requests

subscription_key = "your subscription key"
search_term = "Microsoft"
search_url = "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/news/search"
```

## Create parameters for the request

Add your subscription key to a new dictionary, using `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` as the key. Do the same for your search parameters.

```python
headers = {"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" : subscription_key}
params  = {"q": search_term, "textDecorations": True, "textFormat": "HTML"}
```

## Send a request and get a response

1. Use the requests library to call the Bing Visual Search API with your subscription key, and the dictionary objects you created in the previous step.

    ```python
    response = requests.get(search_url, headers=headers, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()
    search_results = json.dumps(response.json())
    ```

2. Access the descriptions of the articles contained in the response from the API, which is stored in `search_results` as a JSON object. 
    
    ```python
    descriptions = [article["description"] for article in search_results["value"]]
    ```

## Display the results

These descriptions can then be rendered as a table with the search keyword highlighted in bold.

```python
from IPython.display import HTML
rows = "\n".join(["<tr><td>{0}</td></tr>".format(desc)
                  for desc in descriptions])
HTML("<table>"+rows+"</table>")
```
