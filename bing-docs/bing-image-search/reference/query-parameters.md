# Image Search API v7 query parameters

The following are the query parameters that a request may include. The Required column indicates whether you must specify the parameter. You must URL encode the query parameter values.

For information about query parameters used to filter the images that Bing returns, see [Filter query parameters](#filter-query-parameters).

These parameters do not affect the list of images that Bing Web Search API returns.
  
|Name|Value|Type|Required
|-|-|-|-
|<a name="cc"></a>cc|A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. For a list of possible values, see [Market codes](market-codes.md#country-codes).<br/><br/>If you set this parameter, you must also specify the [Accept-Language](headers.md#acceptlanguage) header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds in the specified languages and combines it with the country code to determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request. Or, Bing may use an aggregated or default market for the results.<br/><br/>To know which market Bing used, get the [BingAPIs-Market](headers.md#market-header) header in the response.<br/><br/>Use this query parameter and the `Accept-Language` header only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, you should use the `mkt` and `setLang` query parameters.<br/><br/>This parameter and the [mkt](#mkt) query parameter are mutually exclusive &mdash; do not specify both.|String|No
|<a name="count"></a>count|The number of images to return in the response. The actual number delivered may be less than requested. The default is 35 and the maximum is 150.<br/><br/>You may use this parameter along with the `offset` parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface presents 20 images per page, set `count` to 20 and `offset` to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment `offset` by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40).<br/><br/>Use this parameter only when calling the `/images/search` endpoint. Do not specify this parameter when calling the `/images/trending` endpoint.|UnsignedShort|No
|<a name="id"></a>id|An ID that uniquely identifies an image. The [Image](response-objects.md#image) object's `imageId` field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.<br/><br/>For the `/images/search` endpoint, you use this parameter to ensure that the specified image is the first image in the list of images that Bing returns.|String|No
|<a name="mkt"></a>mkt|The market where the results come from. Typically, `mkt` is the country where the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form \<language>-<country/region>. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values, see [Market codes](market-codes.md).<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in Market codes, Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject to change.<br/><br/>To know which market Bing used, get the [BingAPIs-Market](headers.md#market-header) header in the response.<br/><br/>This parameter and the [cc](#cc) query parameter are mutually exclusive &mdash; do not specify both.|String|No  
|<a name="offset"></a>offset|The zero-based offset that indicates the number of search results to skip before returning results. The default is 0. The offset should be less than ([totalEstimatedMatches](response-objects.md#totalestimatedmatches) - `count`).<br/><br/>Use this parameter along with the `count` parameter to page results. For example, if your user interface displays 10 search results per page, set `count` to 10 and `offset` to 0 to get the first page of results. For each subsequent page, increment `offset` by 10 (for example, 0, 10, 20). It is possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates, see [nextOffset](response-objects.md#nextoffset).<br/><br/>Use this parameter only when calling the `/images/search` endpoint. Do not specify this parameter when calling the `/images/trending` endpoint.|Unsigned Short|No
|<a name="query"></a>q|The user's search query term. The term may not be empty.<br/><br/>The term may contain [Bing Advanced Operators](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/advanced-search-options-b92e25f1-0085-4271-bdf9-14aaea720930). For example, to limit results to a specific domain, use the **site:** operator (q=fishing+site:fishing.contoso.com). Note that the results may contain results from other sites depending on the number of relevant results found on the specified site.<br/><br/>Use this parameter only when calling the `/images/search` endpoint. Do not specify this parameter when calling the `/images/trending` endpoint.|String|Yes
|<a name="safesearch"></a>safeSearch|Used to filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter values:<br/><ul><li>Off &mdash; May return images with adult content. If the request is through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy).<br/><br/></li><li>Moderate &mdash; If the request is through the Image Search API, the response doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)).<br/><br/></li><li>Strict &mdash; Do not return images with adult content.</li></ul>The default is Moderate.<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that `safeSearch` be set to Strict, Bing ignores the `safeSearch` value and uses Strict.<br/><br/>**NOTE:** If you use the `site:` query operator, there is a chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what the `safeSearch` query parameter is set to. Use `site:` only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content.|String|No  
|<a name="setlang"></a>setLang|The language to use for user interface strings. You may specify the language using either a 2-letter or 4-letter code. Using 4-letter codes is preferred.<br/><br/>For a list of supported language codes, see [Bing supported languages](market-codes.md#bing-supported-language-codes).<br/><br/>Bing loads the localized strings if `setlang` contains a valid 2-letter neutral culture code (**fr**) or a valid 4-letter specific culture code (**fr-ca**). For example, for **fr-ca**, Bing loads the **fr** neutral culture code strings.<br/><br/> If `setlang` is not valid (for example, **zh**) or Bing doesnâ€™t support the language (for example, **af**, **af-na**), Bing defaults to **en** (English).<br/><br/>To specify the 2-letter code, set this parameter to an ISO 639-1 language code.<br/><br/>To specify the 4-letter code, use the form \<language>-<country/region> where \<language> is an ISO 639-1 language code (neutral culture) and <country/region> is an ISO 3166 country/region (specific culture) code. For example, use **en-US** for United States English.<br/><br/>Although optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set `setLang` to the same language specified by `mkt` unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a different language.<br/><br/>This parameter and the [Accept-Language](headers.md#acceptlanguage) header are mutually exclusive &mdash; do not specify both.<br/><br/>A user interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects use the specified language.|String|No  

## Filter query parameters
